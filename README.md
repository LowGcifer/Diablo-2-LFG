# Diablo-2-LFG

This is a LFG (Looking for Group) Website for the video game Diablo 2: Resurrected. It is intended for console players (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch), although it is usable by 
PC players as well. 
The console versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected have an in-game matchmaking system, but it is very flawed and doesn't work. Many times players will
find themselves put in empty games. This has left the console versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected to be mostly a solo experience. This website aims to give
console players a straightforward way to find people to play with. Players can opt to create a group and select their own parameters for the group, or 
they can search for existing groups that meet their parameters. To make things simple and quick, there is no login/signup process. Users will input their
platform-dependent username when either creating or searching for a group.
